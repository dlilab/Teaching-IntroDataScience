## What is exploratory data analysis (EDA)?

Exploratory data analysis is all about creative investigation to generate new ideas (instead of answering some specific questions or "confirmatory" data analysis).

Uses of EDA:

- Get some general sense of your data
- Data diagnostics and cleaning for quality control
- Following up "huh" moments: why?
- Find patterns in data
- Hoping for an "a-ha" moment: new ideas
- Suggest modeling strategies

Questions you should ask when conduct EDA:

- what were you trying to do?
- what youâ€™re thinking about?
- what did you observe?
- what did you conclude, and why?


## Some details

Useful functions to get an overview of datasets:

```{r}
str(iris)
summary(iris)
```

Also, **make lots of plots** because summary won't tell everything! Scatter plots, boxplots, histograms, etc. Pay attention to scales (you may want to take logs when data differ order of magnitude).

[Anscombe's quartet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anscombe%27s_quartet)

![Anscombe's quartet: All four sets are identical when examined using simple summary statistics, but vary considerably when graphed](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ec/Anscombe%27s_quartet_3.svg/1280px-Anscombe%27s_quartet_3.svg.png)

Try to ask these questions at the begining of EDA: **what might have gone wrong? How can we reveal such problems?**

**Pay attention to**: 

- units: what are the units of variables? some observation may have units messed up (g vs mg, km vs mile, etc.)
- scales: consider to take logs
- outliers: real?? error?? Do they affect results?
- missing values: how many? any pattern in observations with mssing values? missing values that shouldn't be (e.g., derived values are not missing)? missing value code (e.g., 999)? telling us about sampling quality? Affect results by introducing bias??
- categorical data with inconsistent categories: letter cases, synonyms, dates missing year, etc.
- weird rounding patterns
- subject IDs: unique? duplicated? missing? messed up? present in multiple tables so that they can be joined?

Don't trust anyone, including yourself: too good to be true? Artifacts?

Even more importantly, don't stop from there, follow up and try to figure out the reasons behind artifacts: they might be the most interesting and unexpected results.


**Important principles**:

- Slow down and document what and why you have done, ideally as comments within your code script
- Have sympathy for your future self
