???

ask students what kind of large datasets exist in their field of research

# Data science processes

.font200[
1. Define the question of interest

2. Get the data

3. Clean and prepare the data

4. Explore the data

5. Fit models to extract insights

6. Tell, explain, and illustrate results

These steps are the most time consuming ones, so better to make them (and others) reproducible
