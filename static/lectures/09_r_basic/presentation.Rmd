```

In today's lecture, we will continue to talk about R basics. Specifically, we will cover missing values, factors, date times, and subsetting.

# Missing values `NA`

In R, missing values are represented with `NA` (not applicable). One main feature of `NA` is that it is infectious: **most computations involving a missing value will return another missing value.**

```{r}
NA * 10
NA + 5
```

**Exceptions exist when some identity holds for all possible inputs**

```{r}
NA ^ 0
TRUE | NA
FALSE & NA
```

Because of these propagation, we need to be very careful when dealing with values including `NA`. For example

```{r}
v_na = c(1, 2, 3, NA)
mean(v_na)
mean(v_na, na.rm = TRUE) # most math function has `na.rm` option
v_na == NA
is.na(v_na)
```

Four types of missing values: `NA` (logical), `NA_integer_` (integer), `NA_real_` (double), and `NA_character_` (character). But in most cases, we don't need to worry about it because `NA` will be automatically coerced to the correct type.

# S3 objects

An S3 object is a base type with at least a `class` attribute. A generic function can do different things to different S3 objects. An example is the `str()` function, it returns different outputs when the inputs are different (e.g., a vector vs. a data.frame)

```{r out.width='50%', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/baa19d0ebf9b97949a7ad259b29a1c4ae031c8e2/8e9b8/diagrams/vectors/summary-tree-s3-1.png")
```

## Factor

A factor is a vector that can contain only predefined values. This is normalyl used to store categorical data (e.g., spring, summer, fall, winter). A factor is an integer vector with two attributes: a `class` (factor) that makes it behave differently from an integer vector, and a `levels` that defines allowed values.

```{r}
v_f = factor(v_seasons <- c("spring", "summer", "fall", "winter"))
v_f
typeof(v_f)
attributes(v_f)

v_f2 = factor(c("spring", "fall"), levels = v_seasons)
v_f2
table(v_f2) # it will count all levels

v_f3 = ordered(c("spring", "winter", "fall"), levels = v_seasons)
v_f3
v_f3[4] = "weather" # only predefined values allowed
v_f3
```

**Note: factors are build on integer vectors, even though they look like characters**. So it is usually best to convert factors to character vectors if you need to deal with strings.


```{r}
as.integer(v_f)
as.integer(v_f3)
as.character(v_f)
```

## Dates

Date vectors are built on top of double vectors, with a `Date` class. 

```{r}
today <- Sys.Date()
typeof(today)
attributes(today)
```

The value represents the number of days since 1970-01-01.

```{r}
(date <- as.Date("1970-01-02"))
unclass(date)
```

## Date-times

Date-time information is saved in base R as two ways: POSIXct and POSIXlt. “POSIX” is short for Portable Operating System Interface, which is a family of cross-platform standards. “ct” stands for calendar time, and “lt” for local time.

POSIXct vectors are built on top of double vectors, where the value represents the number of seconds since 1970-01-01.

```{r}
now_ct <- as.POSIXct("2021-09-28 09:20", tz = "US/Central")
now_ct
typeof(now_ct)
attributes(now_ct)
unclass(now_ct)
structure(now_ct, tzone = "Asia/Shanghai")
```

**[The R package `lubridate` can make dealing with most date-time data easy.](https://lubridate.tidyverse.org/)** Make sure to install it and check it out.


# Subsetting

Till now, we have covered most data structures (`str()`) in R. Now we are moving on to learn how to access specified elements of each common data structures.

- Six ways to subset atomic vectors
- Three subsetting operators: `[`, `[[`, and `$`; they interact differently with different vector types
- Subsetting can be combined with assignment, making it powerful to edit data

## Atomic vectors

We can use `[` to select any number of elements from a vector. There are six ways to do so.

### Positive integers

```{r}
x = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
```

```{r}
x[c(1, 5)]
# Duplicate indices will duplicate values
x[c(1, 1)]
# Real numbers are silently truncated to integers
x[c(2.1, 3.9)]
```

### Negative integers _exclude_ elements at the specified positions

```{r}
x[-c(3, 1)]
x[c(-1, -3)]
```


```{r eval=FALSE}
x[c(-1, 3)]
# Error in x[c(-1, 3)] : only 0's may be mixed with negative subscripts
```

### Logical vectors select elements where the corresponding logical value is `TRUE`.

```{r}
x[c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)]
x[c(TRUE, FALSE)] # recycle
# NA in, NA out
x[c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, NA, TRUE)]
x[c(TRUE, NA)] 
x[x %% 2 != 0] # Modulus (x mod 2)
```

### Nothing returns the original vector

```{r}
x[]
```

### Zero returns a zero-length vector

```{r}
x[0]
```

### Character vector if the vector is named

```{r}
names(x) = letters[1:5]
x
x[c("c", "a", "b")]
x[c("a", "a", "a")]
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
x[factor("b")] # get what??
x[factor("e")] # get what??
```

## Lists

Use `[` to select elements of a list will always return results as a list. `[[` and `$` will extract the elements of a list. `[[` is used for extracting single items, while `x$y` is a useful shorthand for `x[["y"]]`.

```{r}
x_l = list(c(1:5), letters[1:3], c(TRUE, FALSE))
x_l[c(1, 3)]
x_l[2]

x_l[[2]]
x_l[[c(2, 3)]]
```

When a list is named, we can use `$`.

```{r}
names(x_l) = c("A", "B", "C")
x_l
x_l[["B"]]
x_l$B
```

>If list `x` is a train carrying objects, then `x[[5]]` is the object in car 5; `x[4:6]` is a train of cars 4-6.
>               — @RLangTip, https://twitter.com/RLangTip/status/268375867468681216

```{r eval=FALSE}
x = list(1:3, "a", 4:6)
```

```{r out.width='60%', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/1f648d451974f0ed313347b78ba653891cf59b21/8185b/diagrams/subsetting/train.png")

knitr::include_graphics("https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/ef5798a60926462b9fc080afb0145977eca70b83/039f5/diagrams/subsetting/train-multiple.png")

```



## Matrix and arrary


You can subset higher-dimensional structures in three ways:

- With multiple vectors.
- With a single vector.
- With a matrix.

The most common way of subsetting matrices (2D) and arrays (>2D) is a simple generalisation of 1D subsetting: **supply a 1D index for each dimension, separated by a comma**. 

Blank subsetting is now useful because it lets you keep all rows or all columns.


```{r}
a <- matrix(1:9, nrow = 3)
colnames(a) <- c("col_1", "col_2", "col_3")
rownames(a) <- c("row_1", "row_2", "row_3")
a
a[1:2, ]
a[c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE), c("col_3", "col_1")]
a[0, -2]
```

By default, `[` will simplify results to the lowest possible dimensionality. For example, if we only select a row or a column of a matrix, then the results will be a vector instead of a matrix.

```{r}
a[1,]
class(a[1,])
class(a)
a[1, , drop = FALSE]
class(a[1, , drop = FALSE])
a[2, 2]
a[2, 2, drop = FALSE]
```

Because both matrices and arrays are just vectors with special attributes, you can **subset them with a single vector**, as if they were a 1D vector.

```{r}
a[]
a[c(1, 5, 9)]
a[a %% 2 == 0]
a2 = a
a2[a2 %% 2 == 0] = -1
a2
```

It is also possible to **subset with a matrix**. Each row in the matrix specifies the location of one value, with each column corresponds to a dimension in the matrix or array.

```{r}
select_mat <- matrix(ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE, c(
  1, 1,
  2, 2,
  3, 3
))
select_mat
a[select_mat]

a
upper.tri(a)
a[upper.tri(a)]
```

## Data frame

Recall that data frame has properties of both list and matrix. So when subset a data frame with one vector, it will act as a list and return the elements (columns) of the list.

```{r}
(df = data.frame(x = 1:5, y = rnorm(5), z = letters[1:5]))
df[c(1, 3)]
df[c("x", "z")]
```

When subset with two indices, it will act as a matrix.

```{r}
df[1:2, 2:3]
df[1:3,]
df[, 1:2]
df[df$x == 3,]
df[df$x %% 2 == 0,]
df[df$x %% 2 == 0 | df$x == 3,]
df[3,]
str(df[3,])
df[3, 3]
str(df[3, 3])
df[3, 3, drop = FALSE]
str(df[3, 3, drop = FALSE])
```

The default `drop = TRUE` behaviour is a common source of bugs in functions; try to use `drop = FALSE` when subsetting a 2-D object. Or try the `tibble` package, which uses `tibble` class to represent data frame and will always use `drop = FALSE`.


## S4 object and `@` and `slot()`

For S4 objects, we can use two operators to subset: `@` (equivalent to `$`) and `slot()` (equivalent to `[[`). We won't talk more about it in this course.
